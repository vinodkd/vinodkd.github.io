<h2 id="about-this-website">About this website</h2>
<p>This website has been in the making for an inordinately long amount of time because I wanted to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>control all aspects of it’s implementation, i.e., I wanted to be able to port it to any hosting provider easily. Local static site generation was always the intent, therefore.</li>
  <li>build it with as-close-to-zero-as-possible local dependencies, i.e., I wanted it containerized before Docker was a thing. So years later, when it finally was here, I restarted</li>
  <li>This other thing about the design of the site that has a para below</li>
  <li>I got busy doing other things.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-design-of-this-website">The design of this website</h3>

<p>I have had along held desire to make this website reflect the “true” nature of the web:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The site itelf looks like a web of links, and the home page should be essentially a visual representation of its contents, with links</li>
  <li>Each page should look like it’s a node in a graph, and navigating from one node to another should leave the reader with a visual memory of the navigation from one part of the graph to another</li>
</ul>
