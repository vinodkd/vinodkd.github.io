<h1>The tiny app platform</h1>
<div class='post'>
small..tiny..those were the keywords with which I went shopping for a database and an app server. The client of course, was to be the browser, so I didnt bother too much about that one - the idea being that the one external piece of software the "app anywhere" platform would depend on would be the browser. How naive I was in those early days!<br /><br />Back to the db and App Server in the meanwhile.<br /><br />I'd used <a href="http://www.hsqldb.org">hsqldb</a> before, so that was an obvious choice for a free, opensource java db. So that was that as far as the backend was concerned.<br /><br />As for the app server - any EJB server was out of the question because a) anything that verbose didnt come without flab and more importantly b) because i just dont like EJB :). Hey its my app, i make the rules!<br /><br />I'd been a big fan of <a href="http://www.vqsoft.com/vq/server/index.html">vqServer</a> a while ago and went looking for it, but seems to have not been updated lately, so I looked at the other good thing I knew about - <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">jetty</a>. The latest docs seemed to show much promise, and at 20-some-odd MB, a real good fit for my purpose.<br /><br />Time to get a little organized. So I started with the primordial directory structure:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4269/3466/1600/aa1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4269/3466/320/aa1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>(Not shown: hsqldb.jar in the jetty/ext dir)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And then I came upon this <a href="http://www.benjysbrain.com/misc/cdsite/index.html">superb writeup on creating exactly what I wanted</a>. The author intended it to be a "run-from-cd" app, but cd to pen drive is a short sneeze away. And the util servlets absolutely were the topping!</div>
