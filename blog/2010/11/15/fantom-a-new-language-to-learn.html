        <p>Today I discovered <a href="http://fantom.org/">Fantom </a>- a surprisingly interesting language that seems to get so many things right. My first thought was to re-implement Joey in it. We’ll see.<br /><br />The language is definitely interesting - especially considering 2 brothers built it in the (mostly) spare time.<br /><br />Things to learn from/use:<br /><br /><ul><li>Fan(tom) is self hosting, ie the compiler is written in fan itself. So building it from source involves using an older release of fan. This is pretty standard in compiler land, I guess, but still novel to me; and probably novel in that the although the final executable is a native binary, it goes through intermediate non-binary output levels</li><li>It compiles to its own intermediate code called fcode, primarily because the original intent was to be able to generate code that worked the same on Java and dotnet.</li><li>Javascript compile - sweet.</li><li>The FWT toolkit - havent started using it yet, but any library that allows declarative UI is good in my book. Especially since the same fan source can be used to generate  web ui a la extJS.</li><li>It also seems to have a fluent api to building html - another nice thing</li><li>Units (a la Frink) and a datetime api with durations built in.</li></ul><br /><br />PS: When I saw the link in LtU I half expected it to be inspired by the Phantom, but apparently not. I have decided, however, that if I do develop in fantom, the projects will be Phantom themed :)</p>
