        <p>Sometimes I reach a page through a long and circuitous traversal of the interwebs, and I wonder how I reached there. It would be nice if there was a browser plugin that showed me that path.<br /><br />And no, the back button is not exactly the answer because of new tabs.<br /><br />Better: We need a browser that shows the part of the web that has just been browsed as a graph, so other traversals can be considered openly instead of through our memory of where we have been!</p>
