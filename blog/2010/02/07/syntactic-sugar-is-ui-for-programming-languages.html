<h1>Syntactic Sugar IS UI for programming languages</h1>
<div class='post'>
I'm reading Paul Graham's On Lisp, and this section from the chapter on macros struck me as interesting:<br /><blockquote>Backquote is usually used for making lists.1 Any list generated by backquote can also be generated by using list and regular quotes. The advantage of backquote is just that it makes expressions easier to read, because a backquoted expression resembles the expression it will produce.</blockquote>...<br /><blockquote>The longer the macro definition, however, the more important it is to use backquote</blockquote>&nbsp;This may not be original, but I just realized that syntactic sugar is the UI for programmers. It just happens to be stuck in the limitation of text. I couldnt help but think that a Structured Editor would obviate the need for backquotes, or the usual "lisp is full of parens" complaint.<br /><br />All they were trying to do was to make a UI for the programmer</div>
