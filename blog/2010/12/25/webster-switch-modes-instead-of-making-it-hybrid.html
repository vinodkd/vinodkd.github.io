        <p>I just had a brainwave: I have been mulling about ways to bypass the creation of a hybrid editor, when it seems like there’s an easier way: allow fluid change to text mode of the whole document.<br /><br />When you dont want to treat the code as code, just switch to text, and use text semantics. Simple :)<br /><br />Of course, change “whole document” to “part of document” and you get a hybrid editor for free.<br /><br />Which of course, goes back to the “islands of one language floating in a sea of another” idea that I’ve been mulling about. What if the “document” was actually a disjoint data structure held together by multiple instances of small editors? Each such editor would handle its own language fragment.<br /><br />More thought required, obviously :)</p>
