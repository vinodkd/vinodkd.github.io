<h1>A delicious alternative</h1>
<div class='post'>
Delicious is the one intenet resource I use, and that is now on the verge of being sold or shutdown. Here's my idea of an alternative. As always, I like them to be self-sustained, and preferable controllable by my self.<br /><br />All we need is a web server, and hits to a particular url in which the link to be saved is contained. The url doesnt even need to be active; it just needs to log to the web server's logs. An offline job runs as frequently as needed, trawls the logs, extracts the links and stores it.<br /><br />Entry and viewing of the link database is mediated through a browser plugin as now, because that's the most common usage anyway.<br /><br />Simple, and as long as you have a web server (which you should anyway), you're good. The only custom component is the offline job.</div>
