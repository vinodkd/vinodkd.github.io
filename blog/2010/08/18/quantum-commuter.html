        <p>This is an idea that I’ve had for quite a while, and thought I’d blogged about already, but apparently I hadn’t.<br /><br />You ever had the choice of two routes to the same destination and wanted to find out if the “road not taken” was the better one? Well this idea is one that’ll help you find out.<br /><br />Chicago’s public transport system - CTA - provides an api to find out bus times and a whole slew of transit related information. The idea is to create an app that allows you to select two (or more) buses/trains that ply between points A and B; and pit them against each other using the API. The display would show a live display of the progress of the buses/trains, and who won.<br /><br />I’ve always wanted to “clone myself” quantum mechanics-style to do something like this IRL, so I call it Quantum Commuter. Nice play on words, even if I say so myself :)<br /><br />Btw, this could be an easter egg in an otherwise normally useful bus tracker app :)</p>
