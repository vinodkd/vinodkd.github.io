<h1>Idea: The "Switch around the And" plugin</h1>
<div class='post'>
I was watching a colleague editing a document, and was struck by the the number of steps he need to change a phase like "cat and dog" and convert it into "dog and cat". I myself have had this problem quite a few times. How difficult would it be to make a plug in (in whatever editor) to automate this simple task?<br /><br />So, this then, is my next idea: Create the "Swith around the And" plugin. For specificity let's call it a Word Plugin. But no reason to stop there - how about for most other editors?<br /><br />In fact, when I think about, this could become like one of those projects that write "hello world" in every possible language. The "And switch" plugin for everything from vim to word to what have you :)<br /><br />And of course, this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Why stop at just "and" as the matching pattern? Why not add this as a feature to any code editor so swapping arguments of a binary operator is easy and automated?<br /><br />Todo: Somebody must have done this already. Google it.</div>
