        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Its been almost 9 months since I've blogged!<br /><br />I realized it only yesterday.<br /><br />A lot has happened in that gap &nbsp;- I moved halfway across the globe, was in "transit housing" before and after, getting adjusted to the new place and so forth.<br /><br />However, there's another reason for the dry up in blog content: I started building more and - more importantly - started journaling my work within each project.<br /><br />The "building more" piece came from an an increased focus on finishing. Not that I'm good at it, but I'm moving in that direction.<br /><br />The "journaliing" piece came from switching projects too much and having to spend a lot of time catching up with where I was when I left off last. However, it quickly became a "pensieve" of sorts - a place where I store my thoughts and half-baked ideas on how to move forward with that project. Since most (all?) my projects are single-person ones, its easy for me to plop in a journal.md and just start writing.<br /><br />So, in some sense, the ideas that I come up with used to be put up here as blog posts now are likely ending up as another project folder on my laptop. It also is probable that the bandwidth that I had for ideas in general is now being channelled into specific ideas for projects that I'm already working on.<br /><br />Anyhoo, that's by way of apology to the teeming millions visiting this blog :)<br /><br />Since this is the end of the year, I usually end up thinking about what I've achieved and do some half hearted attempt at a resolution list. Not that I actually execute on that list, but its good to at least think about it once a year :)<br /><br />So here's what I'd like to focus on in 2014: Actually finish up (even a v1.0) of these projects:<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>my website</li><li>GUTS</li><li>plnext</li><li>ed</li></ol><div>This should be quite enough considering I'm staring a part-time masters soon. Hopefully I wont get derailed with <a href="https://github.com/vinodkd/jmx.js">weekend projects that take 2 months to reach v1.0</a>, but hey - that's the fun of personal projects, right?</div><div><br /></div><div>On the bright side, that project was <a href="http://tt2n.blogspot.com/2013/02/jmeter-as-webapp.html">something that I always wanted to do</a>, so there's always a bright side :)</div><div><br /></div></div>
