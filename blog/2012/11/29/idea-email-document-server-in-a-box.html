        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I dont yet have a good name for this concept, but here's the idea anyway:<br /><br />You know a lot of good ideas are better put in an email instead of a separate document because people will not open that attachment?<br /><br />What if you could actually then easily extract out such content and make it available as a document? Further, what if the original recipients of your email continue to see it as an email, but it has a separate life as a document?<br /><br />This is what I mean by the Email server being a document server as well. Each email could contain multiple such documents; or each email could itself be a document. The inline vs attachment line is blurred, but at the same time, individual bits within emails become addressable entities outside of the email thread.<br /><br />Right now, we save such emails, re-format them as documents and stick them in a wiki or sharepoint. What if the Email server did all this for us?<br /><br /></div>
