Its retail therapy for her, pure hell for you.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Enter the Hubby Hangout.</div><div><br /></div><div>This establishment, conveniently located at the start of the shopping district or entrance of the mall is a well appointed sports bar/lounge. The moment you check in, it provides a swipe card to your spouse, who then heads off to the aisles. HH's ties with the other businesses around ensures that your spouse can shop at will using the swipe card and every purchase will come to you for approval and payment on a display next to your scotch. You accept the payment&nbsp;(do you really have a choice?)&nbsp;and return to your game/show/parcheesi play/whatever.</div><div><br /></div><div>Eons later, spouse emerges with half the merchandise from the area and HH's helpful concierge has been following her throughout carrying the day's take. They bring the chariot around, help load the stuff in, and off you go.</div><div><br /></div><div>Did you imagine shopping could be so pleasant?</div><div><br /></div><div>I'd pay for that!</div></div>
