In half-hour increments. For when you've eaten your fill at the Food Court and JUST WISH you could lie down somewhere. They dont wake you up by default (and charge your card something pricey), but they do have the option of the rude wakeup for the cost-conscious.<br /><br />If successful, this is just looking to become a franchise and worldwide success. After all, who doesn't want to sleep :)?<br /><br />2 more ideas to follow soon.</div>
