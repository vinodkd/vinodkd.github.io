And even if you did as a kid, wouldn't you like to play in those fun environments again?<br /><br />This then is the idea: A playhouse that's adults only. Adult sized trampolines. Acres of foam and rubber floored space where you can bounce about like a kid. Adult sized bouncy castles. No kids allowed.<br /><br />In fact, we'll take your kid to his/her own little play area so you can have all the fun you want!<br /><br />I'd pay for that! &nbsp;</div>
