<h1>Of Phonewords and Carpet Jingles: Its funny how the brain works</h1>
<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="tr_bq">I was talking to a colleague about how my android phone's dialer doesn't have some basic features - like the ability to paste a number directly into it (LG Optimus 500, 2.2 - ymmv).</div><br />...which led to..<br /><br />Me remembering how Blackberries had the ability to dial phonewords directly by pressing Alt.<br /><br />...which led me to two things:<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Googling if android does the same. It doesn't looks like it does. Funnily, all searches led to blackberry forums where the Alt trick is described. Isn't progress wonderful?</li><li>Googling 800-588-2300 - the one number (and jingle) I cannot forget.</li></ol><br />... which led me to..<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/102943/8005882300">metafilter discussion about Empire and the empire man</a>.<br /><br />... which led me to...<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Wonder how I remember seeing the commercial in NJ when the post doesn't list it as one of states in which Empire operates? Maybe I remember it from my time in Florida? Man, that would make it memorable for a decade! That's some recall power for a product that I've not ever bought.</li><li>Now run around the whole day in <b>Bangalore </b>singing both the Empire AND Luna jingles!</li></ol><br /><br />PS: Best quotes from the metafilter page:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The man has gone, but the goddamn jingle will never die. I hope Hauldren's heaven is plush and stain resistant, with no monthly payments til July</blockquote>and:<br /><blockquote>"we're been getting some ads in the same form for Luna carpet, but I haven't the foggiest idea what their phone number is."<br />877-241-LUNA. I'm ashamed of myself for knowing that.<br />What? No. 773-202-(boop beep boop beep) LUNAAAAA.&nbsp;</blockquote></div></div>
