        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Hacker News had a post titled "<a href="http://www.lispcast.com/modern-language-wishlist">Modern Language Wishlist</a>". I bookmarked it, perused the comments that tried to guess the language that the post was alluding to, and finally clicked over to the actual article.<br /><br />While the list is a pretty good and pragmatic one, I can't help but feel that we programmers are a content lot. All the things on the wishlist were incremental improvements at best.<br /><br />We build these big skyscrapers using tools that were used to build huts, methinks. Shouldn't the prime questions be:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">What is the biggest "thing" that a programming language models?</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">And how close is this to an <b>actual running application</b>?</span><br /><br />... I ask?&nbsp;</div>
