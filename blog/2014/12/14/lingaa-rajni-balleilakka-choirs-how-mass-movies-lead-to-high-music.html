        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So I watched Lingaa yesterday.<br /><br />Because of which I was googling and youtubing for rajni's impact outside india; and was largely expecting to find videos from japan - which I did.<br /><br />But what was really interesting is that I found at least 5 to 6 videos of one song from Rajni's last movie - Sivaji - being sung by school choirs across US.<br /><br />The song's called Balleilakka, and here's the original:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tma8zoLEPJU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tma8zoLEPJU</a><br /><br />Here's a sampler of schools choirs singing it:<br /><br />Best that I found: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQWLqcNr9B8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQWLqcNr9B8</a><br />Really fast: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvo1_vLGAGo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvo1_vLGAGo</a><br />Pretty good, but smattering of indians :) : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUhMQYW-xmk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUhMQYW-xmk</a><br />Pretty good: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09C8s1QhgqE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09C8s1QhgqE</a><br />Shitty accoustics, but points for the effort: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJYVAB8XQU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSJYVAB8XQU</a> <br /><br /><br />.. and I began to wonder: why this song alone? None of them actually mentioned the source of the song; they usually called it an indian song in tamil. I think one mentioned that its AR Rehman's song.<br /><br />So they were actually using it because it was a complex song musically - it was a tongue twister even for natural speakers of the language and what was really obvious from listening to it when sung by a chorus is that it had many layers and voices to it. I dont obviously know the right musical terms here, but in programming terms, it was a mutlithreaded song - multiple concurrent voices had to be active to make it happen, and each voice was sure to get knotted up in the tongue twister lyrics; not to mention that the beat was really fast! No wonder the choruses are taking it up as a challenge.<br /><br />Its amazing that I live in a time when composers like Rehman have enough commercial clout to put complex music into a movie meant for the masses. Even better: not only do the intended audiences love the song, so do people who are serious about music!<br /><br /></div>
