        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Had this idea while in a meeting at work today where ADA was being talked about; and how making a page ADA compliant required reordering the markup - sometimes entirely.<br /><br />What if the screen reader didn't read sequentially - like a queue of people who talk to a teller - and instead read everything that's on a page at the same time - almost like a marketplace where everyone's talking at the same time?<br /><br />I'm not blind, but I have to imagine that this is how blind people perceive the real world anyway - as a cacophony of sounds that they have to filter out noise from. This is not that different from fully able people sensing the world and filtering what's important.<br /><br />If we had such a screen reader, the document markup could be the cue for how "loud" each element would be, child elements could be "muted" in favor of the parent and so forth.<br /><br />Todo: check if screen readers already do this.</div>
