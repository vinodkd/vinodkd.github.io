        <div style="text-align: justify;">- "everything is  a graph": the problem (as is obvious from various discussions on the web on the topic) with structured editors is to allow seamless editing of code. the standard example being converting a for loop to a while loop. My idea is to treat everything as being part of a graph, with infinite breakdown. The default level will be at the "syntax" level, but if you want to break that further, press a hotkey, and the syntax-based placeholders and user inputs get reduced to text nodes.<br /><br />Superficially, this is similar to the "hybrid editors" that have  a mode to switch to text input which is then parsed back. But the key difference is that the conceptual graph is retained.<br /><br />Combine this with the leaf based parsing should help keep the experience smooth.<br /><br />Some more thought:<br />operations allowed by a text editor<br /></div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>navigate text</li><li>create, modify and delete text</li><li>copy and paste arbitrary text, either in line mode or block mode</li></ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> <br />to emulate this, how about a structured editor has a "text grid" view<br /></div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>at every text grid event, the structure model is notified, and it changes the model accordingly</li><li>if a placeholder value is changed, no model changes are required, just the slot value has to change</li><li>if a keyword is changed, a triage construct consisting of the following is constructed:</li><blockquote><li>the rest of the structure is retained in the anticiaption of rollback,</li><li>a new structure is anticipated and candidates are stored, which through multiple events may get realized into an actual new structure</li></blockquote><li>if a new structure is realized, the old one is discarded</li><li>the engine will aim for the quickest new structure that can be realized, given the language syntax</li></ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
