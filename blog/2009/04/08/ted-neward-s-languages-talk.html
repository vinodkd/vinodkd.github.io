        <p>Ted Neward gave a talk at my office, and spoke about Languages, and how we’re seeing a renaissance of languages currently. I spoke to him afterwards about visual programming, and his comment was:<br /><br />“You know, every time I do this talk, someone comes to me afterwards and asks about visual programming. The thing is: text is currently the most succinct way to represent code”<br /><br />I had to agree with him. But I thought some more about it later, and felt that while that that’s true for presentation of code, it need not be for its persistence. Why should text also be the storage mechanism?</p>
