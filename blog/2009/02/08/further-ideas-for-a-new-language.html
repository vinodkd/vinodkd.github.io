<h1>Further Ideas for a new language</h1>
<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Some more random additions to the new language idea:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">A name: Jack</span><br />This is mostly tongue in cheek but I thought if I ever got around to creating this language, I'd call it Jack. You know, like in Jack of all trades, cos its trying to be one - with its polyglot leanings. I did consider calling it Poly, but the options for source file name extensions would be .pl or .py or .ply. First two are taken, and the third doesn't seem that interesting. OTOH, .jak comes out nice.<br /><br />Aside, I did also consider calling it V after me, but vetoed it cos it didnt give any indication about the language itself, just self promotion.<br /><br />Anyway, Jack it is. And I've not yet checked if there's already a language with that name - hope not. But think of the possibilities with such a name:<br /><br />- You could tell others off by saying "You dont know Jack"<br />- Like Java Jars and Ruby Gems, there could be Jack (in-the) boxes :)<br />- I know I'm gonna call the hello world in Jack "Jackrabbit slims" :))<br /><br />Enough buffoonery, now for some serious stuff:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">It has optimisations</span><br />You know how you have to "drop down a few layers" to optimize things? Like for eg, you can do 3d graphics using the Java3d APIs or you can use OpenGL or you could just drop into the video card's API? Well, Jack will have the same capability. If a thing can be done in more than one way, and one way is the composition of multiple functions, while the other is a single function that does effectively the same, you will be able to specify that. Instant reuse. Want to use the MFC classes, or OS sys calls to do something? Go right ahead. And supported in the language too. Sandbox to be specified, but definitely much easier than JNI et al - remember I'm still dreaming :).<br /><br />The key thing I want to point out is the "supported in the language" bit. We as programmers routinely cut across language/API boundaries. However, each language is in its own sandbox held together by scripts, duct-tape and magic. Why not be explicit about it? Obviously there will be need for sandboxes, but making it explicit enables maintainability. It should be clear how different parts of the application ecosystem actually connect.</div></div></div>
