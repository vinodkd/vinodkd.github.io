<p>Have you ever had a colleague who wants you to make a change in a system/service/component you own say:</p>

<p>Can’t you <strong>just</strong> do X in < less than a day/ a few days >?</p>

<p>This is typically some senior person in the other team, who’s competent in their domain and would themselves not entertain a similar request against their own system/service component. It doesnt come from a place of malice, but from a mistaken sense of how easy X must be in a domain that’s not theirs. There are also shades of <a href="https://xyproblem.info/">the XY problem</a> in such an ask.</p>

<p>Front end teams typically face it because “UI is easy, just add a button” or “Client libraries are easy, my unit tests are essentially clients to the service”. Backend teams also face it in organizations where front end is king, because it “must be a few lines of validation on the service”. In general, the dominant area of work in a company tends to trivialize the effort that goes into the non-dominant areas.</p>

<p>In my experience, <strong>Nothing is ever easy</strong>. For example, I used to run a system where the title of a page could be changed easily (as one would expect), but adding a comma required minor refactor of the page structure.</p>

<p>Also, complexity abounds in the simplest of things, sometimes related to things being <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/">a big ball of mud</a>. It is easier, for example, to test a service, because operations could be unit tested. On a UI or client library, the useful tests are full use cases, a.k.a integration tests, which needs to factor in state, setting up a headless browser+selenium/cypress, and factoring human think time. Failures are also not cut-and-dry because humans are more forgiving, and succeeding at the 4th try is still “good enough”. This might be seen as a 75% failure if you thought of them as just tests.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-better-at-this">How to get better at this</h2>

<p>If you are the requester, be mindful of your own biases on what is easy vs hard. Try to avoid the “Can’t you just…?” question, and instead ask: “I need your system/service/component to do Y. What would it take to do that?”</p>

<p>If you are the receipient of such a question, don’t agree or defend. Instead ask why they’re asking for X, which might unearth Y. Also, explain your internal architecture a bit so people understand why a change is hard. If you’re a central team with many such requests, invest in an intranet web page/wiki that explains this, and add that to new ticket templates.</p>

<h2 id="post-script">Post script</h2>
<p>I’ve written this down now, but this has been in my mind for many years now. As a manager for multiple front end teams across companies, I saw this pattern of request show up quite often.</p>
