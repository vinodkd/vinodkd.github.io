<h1>My Bowerick Wowbanger homage... aka the wikipedia breadth-first read</h1>
<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I've been meaning to start this for quite a while now.<br /><br />If you've read the Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy, you'll probably remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_characters#Wowbagger.2C_the_Infinitely_Prolonged">Wowbanger the Infintely prolonged who takes upon himself to insult every living being in alphabetical order just to keep himself busy?</a><br /><br />Well, aside from the immortality, the need to keep myself busy and the insulting bits, this is my Wowbanger-esque project.<br /><br />I've started reading the Wikipedia at the Computer Science page, and I aim to keep reading it in breadth-first fashion from that page onwards. I hope to read one page every day. Along the way, I'll <a href="https://github.com/vinodkd/read_wiki_cs">track my course with a graphviz graph</a> that will eventually be a map of the wikipedia subtree (subgraph?) that is rooted at "Computer Science". Simple rule for picking the next page to read: I'll pick the one that I know the least about.<br /><br />I've also created a wikipedia account, should it come of use somehow. I'll look to see if I can fix simple typos and such - as they arise; and if there indeed are pages that are stubs that I can fill out, I'll try.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Why</span><br />Because one my (admittedly naive) goals in life when I was still studying was to "know everything there is to know about computers". A decade and a half later I still remember it, so it must mean something. I figure this is the least I can do :)<br /><br />PS: Yes, I did think about what I'd do if a page I'd read already changes. I dunno. We'll see how it goes. Even Wowbanger did Arthur twice :)</div></div>
