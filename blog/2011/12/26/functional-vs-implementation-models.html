<h1>Functional vs Implementation Models</h1>
<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Our apartment building has a down ramp from the elevator to the basement level. My kids usually run down this ramp, stopping just short of the driveway for cars exiting the basement.<br /><br />Of course, they stop short because they've been told that "Cars are coming"; or as my under-2-yr-old says "because car comin".<br /><br />The other day he ran down the ramp as usual, stopped short of the driveway and chanted his usual "because car comin"; then paused to look, said "Car no comin" and proceeded to walk across the driveway.<br /><br />I'd almost started to blurt out the "Look to your left, look to your right, then look to your left again.." routine in an effort to instill traffic safety at a early age (I know, parents) when he said "Car no comin". Since he did that, I kept quiet.<br /><br />It then struck me that his way was much better than the "Look to left routine" because he's formed a mental model of when cars come and when they don't. Once he has that model, he's free to decide what to do: cross the driveway, stay put, or whatever.<br /><br />The problem with the routine is that its prescriptive; and therefore - by definition - too restrictive. How would a child's mind associate such a routine to the situation? It seems to me there are quite a bit of wrong associations that can be made to the one right one:<br /><br />Right:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>When crossing a driveway, do the routine for your own safety.</li></ul><br />Wrong:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>When you run down a ramp, at the end do the routine</li><li>When you stop, do the routine</li><li>When daddy shouts as I'm running down a ramp, stop and do the routine</li></ul><div>More importantly, the value of looking left again will be completely lost on a child IMO. Wouldn't it be much better if he arrived at that step by himself?</div><div><br /></div><div>Thus too, it seems, with software. As long as we build in the right functional models, it should be easy to instill the right implementation model; and by extension - modify or maintain it.</div></div></div>
