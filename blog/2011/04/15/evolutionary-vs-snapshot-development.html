        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">When I suggested to somebody that they can implement a subset of the true solution for now, with the stated intent that the true solution will be implemented later, i realized that there was no way to retain in the codebase itself this future intent.<br /><br />Current development is all snapshot based -and the tip version at that. There is no way to state - in the codebase - that we intend the current state to be a waypoint to some final architectural/design destination.<br /><br />BDD is essentially a means of formalizing requirements into the codebase, and Devops is essentially a means of formalizing the deployment of code into the codebase; why not take the next logical step and add tracking the evolution of the code itself into the codebase? Why use an issue tracker for this?<br /><br />Coming to think of it, why not make this a language feature?</div>
