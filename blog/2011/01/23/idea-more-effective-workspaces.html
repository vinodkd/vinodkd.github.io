        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Workspaces are invaluable in keeping focus on the job at hand. I've been used to Workspaces on Linux Desktops for a long time, and recently discovered a Windows powertoy - MSDVM - that does the same on windows. This idea is a couple that I've had that can make them more effective:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>A per-workspace todo list</b>: So that when you form a plan of what to do in that WS, the plan is visible always</li><li><b>A "Send todos to workspace X" feature</b>: I frequently find myself remembering to do something official while I'm on my personal workspace. It would be nice to be able to send a todo to that todolist without losing context.</li><li><b>An "I'm stepping out" button with tickler for when you return </b>: Click on the I'm stepping away shoudl allow you to enter quick text on what you're currently doing, so you have a high visibility "This is what I was doing before I stepped away" note on the workspace when you return. I constantly find myself doing this using a new notepad instance even though i have other todo lists - just so its front and center when I return. It would be nice if the workspace did it for me.</li></ul>Of course, all of this can be done with current software and some manual setup, but it would be nice if the todo lists were workspace-aware, so this works out of the box.</div>
