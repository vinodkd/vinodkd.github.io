        <p>You go to a meeting room, and typically connect up your laptop to the projector or plasma screen in it.<br />But do you really need to? Why cant you connect wirelessly to the display?<br />That then, is the core of this idea.<br /><br />If the projector/plasma is connected to one machine, others can connect to it wirelessly and display the content of their screens on it.<br /><br />Alternately, the one connected attendee can then easily enable other attendees to use his machine to remotely display their screen contents! This has the added advantage of allowing anybody to use the display, not just the one person connected to it - without the hassle of disconnect/connect/key combo to show etc; not to mention the chance of allowing group participation through easy passing of the display baton.<br /><br />Implementations possible: <br /><ol><li>Xserver on a box thatâ€™s physically connected to a projector/plasma.Wrapper server &amp; client programs that allow Webex/vnc-style connect-ability to project local display onto that display.</li><li>VNC client/server setup with client in listen mode</li><li>Custom wrap of xserver or vnc that automates all this.</li></ol></p>
