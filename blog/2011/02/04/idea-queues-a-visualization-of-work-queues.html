<h1>Idea: Queues: a visualization of work queues</h1>
<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have been thinking about the concepts mentioned in Product Development Flow, and visualizing a dashboard based on the Queues mentioned in that book. An agile team could be represented minimally by a queue - the list of tasks in its backlog, and how the team processes that list. If we had a visualization of this, it would be easy to represent how well/efficiently the team is working<br /><br />Extending this downwards, the team's performance could be measured in different ways: as a summation of each team member's work queue (which would allow per team member productivity and efficiency estimation), or as a summation of work completed, or (even interesting) as a summation of the different workstreams it's currently undertaking.<br /><br />Extending this upwards, a set of teams or the entire organization could be measured in terms of the queues for each team, and the attributes of each queue chosen to be measured.<br /><br />Speaking in software terms, I'm thinking of creating:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>A system that allows the creation of a queue, and a visualization of it.</li><li>The ability to create parent and child queues</li><li>The ability to "sum up" based on arbitrary attributes of each queue</li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div>
