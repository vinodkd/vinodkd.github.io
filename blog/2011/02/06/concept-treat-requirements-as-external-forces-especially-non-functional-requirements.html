<h1>Concept: Treat requirements as external forces, especially non-functional requirements</h1>
<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Along the lines of my idea to <a href="http://tt2n.blogspot.com/2009/06/fem-like-analysis-on-code.html">use FEM-like analysis on code</a>, I realized that it should be possible to model the things that cause the architecture and design of the software over time as physical forces.<br /><br />Case in point: My team is currently working on adding multi-lingual and multi-currency support to a fairly large app. Adding this predictably requires changes across the board, and led me to visualize all the places we're pushing and pulling at the current design/architecture to make this happen.<br /><br />Could this instead be considered a single external force acting on the elements of the system? Can we study the "material properties" of the code under such forces and "sum up" the forces?<br /><br />If we could do that, it would certainly move us out of the current dark ages where cost of change is still measured as a list of things to change per a specific change plan.</div></div>
