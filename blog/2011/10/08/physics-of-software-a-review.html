        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I stumbled upon an interesting <a href="http://www.eptacom.net/PhysicsOfSoftware/Summary.pdf">series of blog posts that attempts to bring in a "physics" for software</a>. This attempt in and of itself seems to me a worthy cause as IMO Computer Science could do with some foundations like these. There's too much on the engineering side and less on the science one.<br /><br />The other reason I liked the series (which I'm still reading) is my own latent ideas on using FEM-ish analysis on the structure of software.<br /><br />Halfway through the series, however, it seems to me that the analysis is overly reliant on real world physical concepts. Software having a center seems fine, as does mass and inertia; but extrapolating that to speed and acceleration seems contrived.<br /><br />My own take is that software DOES have a physics of its own. However, concepts from Natural Physics may be applicable as analogies, but not directly to express this phsyics. My suspicion is that the physics of software would be multi-dimentional (which the author of this series concedes as well), graph-like (which he also alludes to with his attraction-repulsion diagrams), fractal (also stated, but not evolved fully) and much in need for a set of operators that define the effect of change (which I've not found yet in these papers).<br /><br />Still, a very worthy exercise indeed; and one that introduced me to Coplien's forays into the area from the late 90s.&nbsp;Bonus: Reinteroduced me to Christopher Alexander's Design pattern concepts.<br /><br />PS: While the posts dont talk about change, I was led to them via link from Micheal Feather's <a href="http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2011/09/temporal-correlation-of-class-changes.html">attempt to quantify design change by measuring correlation between methods/classes changed in a single commit</a>.</div>
