        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">From the previous posts on Jack's primitive capabilities it should be pretty obvious that it is turing complete. It supports sequences and selection naturally; and&nbsp;allows iteration of any node's children.<br /><br />The intent, however, is to NOT use Jack as a primary programming language. I do not see a hello world in Jack's future - at least not in the conventional sense.<br /><br />Jack's Turing completeness is intended to provide a full complement of computing power so that program logic may be effectively TRANSFORMED. The more appropriate set of hello world would programs may be:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>A program that edited another program and represented the editing as a sequence of Jack steps</li><li>A program that reasoned about another program using Jack</li><li>A program that expressed the history of a program and exposed its "why" using Jack</li><li>A program that expressed the future roadmap of a program using Jack</li></ul></div>
