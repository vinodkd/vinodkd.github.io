        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I like systems that are self contained. No unnecessary dependencies.<br /><br />I woke up today and decided that lispdown needs an implementation. After all, the rules are simple; should be a shell script, right?<br /><br />True; but I couldn't help thinking: shouldn't I write lispdown in Lisp? Whoever needs it (lispdownville: pop 1) obviously will have lisp - and that's all they'll need. Sure they most probably will have bash, but why use it at all?<br /><br />This is the same kind of thought process that led me to build cuke4jas. I found joy in the fact that the application being built and the tools being used to build it are both from the same base platform/language.</div>
