The problem with mind maps, though, is that they implicitly expect a central idea/concept. A "family tree" is indeed one such, but any instance of a family tree cannot have a central <b>anything </b>- the moment you make something (or someone) central, it is but one view into the tree (what you would see from one person's POV, for example).</div><div><br /></div><div>My next tool was Graphviz. I've found Graphviz to be one of those timeless tools that I keep coming back to, and discover new things every time; not to mention its barrier to entry is so low (who can't type text and create graphs?). So the same data from above became this graphviz script:</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><br />- timeline code borrowed from graphviz sample<br />- probs: too complex code<br />- cannot represent each person separately<br />- relationship labels may get onerous when the tree gets big<br />- already seeing opportunity to convert from "how" code to "what code.<br /><br />itn2:<br />- solves each person, but way more complex code<br /><br />itn 3:<br /><br />dsl emerging. thinking of a tool that outputs this gv</div>
