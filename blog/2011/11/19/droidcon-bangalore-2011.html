Here's my somewhat longish take</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">(in schedule order)</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">:</span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;"><br /></span></span></div><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span></span><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><b>The Good:</b></span></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Diogo's keynote on Cyanogenmod's growth and potential. Interesting to know that they support 80 devices. My cheapo LG Optimus P 500 isnt one of them, however :(.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">James Hugman's talk on making X-platform apps suck less. Bonus: the Kirin framework. Interesting idea of writing business logic in javascript, but using the builtin webview-based javascript engine as the runtime. Definitely worth checking out.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Hard Earned Android experiences by Khashif. Lots of sane advice here. Some interesting face-offs with his own (seemingly very young) CEO made me feel like I was at a tennis match but in all a nice talk. Most controversial point: optimizing database writes.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">New features in ICS: Good round up of the new features. Had to ask the question on the new Google expectation to move physical buttons to soft ones even on phones. More on this below.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">App demos: Selected output from the Hacknight event that HasGeek held as a leader for this event. droid2chrome was interesting, as was the bookcompare (i forget the actual name). The former was interesting because most of the team members didn't want to do android and yet managed to do something; while the latter was interesting cos they actually screen scraped book prices from indian vendors!</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Anand Virani's end-of-day talk on the mobile growth wave: I caught the end of this talk but clearly this is a man who can talk and present well. Nice projections on how the mobile world is shaping up. Some sharp questions on open sourcing Qualcomm tech which he quite adroitly side stepped without pissing people off :)&nbsp;</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Tibaut's keynote on i'm not sure exactly what (it had strands of droidcon history,android growth and political incorrectness), but it was by far the most entertaining and engaging talk i've seen in a while :). He made an interesting connection between Minitel - the French govt sponsored draconian internet offering that was in blue, green and while colors - and the recent fragmentation of the mobile market between blue(nokia), green(android) and white(apple). I'm not really sure what his final slide asking us to challenge the status quo of mobile really meant, but he DID get a few hundred indian geeks to actually talk to each other! That's an achievement for sure.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">IPR aka Who let the lawyer in the room: Again, I caught the last 5 mins of this talk, and immediately felt I should have taken it in whole. Malavika looks like she could be the india PJ and she likes open source. I asked her about groklaw's impact on relations between devs and lawyers, to which her quip was: "I think its great because usually developers never read the terms and lawyers never see the apps"! Nice.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Indoor tagging engine: Was intrigued before the session and liked what I saw. Tagin is a project that allows identify indoor locations based on the surrounding wifi beacons. If this thing is accurate 50% of the time, it has great personal potential. The only downside that I see is that you have to have wifi on all the time. Barring that, however, I can think of some simple applications that extend the GPS's accuracy - especially within buildings that have lots of wifi routers - like apartments. Example: "Ding! you're near the mailbox, do you want to drop your bills off?"</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Creating apps that work at all sizes: Lots of good information here for UI devs. I couldn't help but feel that the raster vs vector wars were being fought all over again on mobile, however.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Android and Arduino: Very enthusiastic presenter who knew his stuff and presented it in an honest, no-frills way. Learnt how easy it was to interface with arduino more than anything else; and that all this stuff (and knock-off cheaper boards) were available locally. Now all I have to do is magically make my family disappear so I could just hole up playing with these toys :)</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;"><b>Ok, could be better:</b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><ul style="text-align: left;"><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Tech challenges of apps in limited connectivity: This is a topic that could have been a lot of things - especially given that mobile is becoming cheap and offline apps and syncing them up is something (IMO) a lot of developers should be worrying about. While the initial "here's the problem" part of the talk was good, the rest felt like reading a Craig Larman architecture book - dry, high on theory and boring as hell. If you read between the bullet points, there were gobbles of information just waiting to be let out. They stated the problem, stated the things you have to consider and then stopped. A better approach would have been: "here's the problem, here's the things you have to worry about, and <u>here's what we did. Now lets discuss</u>". My other takeway: offline and sync should be a framework problem, not an app developer one. More on this below.</span></span></li></ul></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;"><b>Meh:</b></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Android Service Patterns: Was over my head because I'm an android tourist dev. However, I'm surprised someone built a new IDL to define service contracts. Doesn't the world have enough of those already without android creating one more? God forbid some (very possible) future where EAI vendors have to support AIDL! Oh look, the horrors of integration combined with those of android fragmentation!</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Honeycomb codelab: There were glitches in the setup - primarily because most people did not have the ICS Dev setup on their machines. It might have helped to have a note on the schedule asking people to prep for this one. Also, there was a whole lot of "how" and no "why" at all in the content - but maybe that's because I don't know the nuances between honeycomb and older versions. And: it WAS called a codelab, so maybe I shouldn't expect theory or reasons. Regardless, it would have been nice to have a brief this is why what we're going to do is important/fun/great. It lacked that oomph, IMO. Personal peeve: Seemed like the presenter was a bit miffed that "in this day and age" we dont have connectivity. The whole tutorial was online, with no way of even getting offline as it was on appspot. We ended up curl-ing the pages so that our unconnected buddies could follow along.</span></li></ul></div></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Note to organizers: Tell people to setup machines prior or tell them about the thumb drives at registration</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Note to speaker: Do not expect a perfect environment; have fallbacks. Most of us were trying very hard to manage to follow you, but a little understanding would go a long way.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Note to self: Read up on the content to know the why before attending a codelab instead of bitching about feeling listless at it :)</span></li></ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Android app: A deconstruction: I was distracted; hence the meh. Seemed like a pretty ok breakdown of building an app for AAA. However, I've attended a similar talk earlier, and the guy then made me want to have the app; so I was interested in how it was made. This was a lot of the hows; and a lot of it was pretty standard stuff when looked at through the lens of web development. My bias, I know.</span></span></li></ul><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span></span><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><b>Did not attend, would have liked to:</b></span></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Android Multimedia Internals</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Pricing models for apps</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Continuous delivery for android apps</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Cloud to device messaging.</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Android Memory optimization</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Enterprise App Development, admin api.</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Close to metal programming with the NDK.</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">OpenGL on Android: My colleague attended it and liked it.</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Humanizing Android.</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Extending android with new devices</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">From stock to CM: Ericsson.</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Smartphone Platform Frameworks.</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Android porting for dummies.</span></span></li></ul><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span></span><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><b>Just plain Did not attend:</b></span></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Android UI secrets: Heard from another guy that this was not as secretive gyaan as expected, but that's second hand info.</span></span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Sensors on UI: My colleagues attended; they were not the right audience, however.

I spoke to at least 2 app developers building their own solutions for these problems, and clearly, these are not application-level problems. "In this day and age".&nbsp;</span></li></ul><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span></span><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><b>Surprises:</b></span></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"></span><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Robosoft: A company based in Udupi, doing Android!

I'm not an RFID expert, but he's the guy to talk to if you are a hobbyist, methinks.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Github: They sponsored the party (which I couldnt attend owing to stupid excuses such as having a family) was conspicuous by they absence.

Love your software, love your support.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">The 2 guys volunteering to set cyanogenmod for random strangers: Completely unplanned, apparently, and completely cool. My LG still didnt get love, sadly.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">Dextera: I learnt that this company from Cochin built a Siri-clone called Iris while at their CEO's session. Have to definitely check it out.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">The venue: Did not expect this good a venue, actually. Except for the small room, a top-notch place; and still a little away from the madding crowd. I particularly liked the steps that also doubled as an access ramp on the way to the courtyard. I'm by no means an architecture expert, but I have not seen that before.</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;"><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;"><b>The experience:</b></span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">Hats off to HasGeek for the organization. I'm one of the entitled bunch that gave them grief about the lack of net connectivity, but Kiran's saga of their attempts to get wifi for a month won me over. Kiran, if you're reading this, I'm the guy who was willing to pay Rs.500 more. You have my apologies.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px;">That said, here are my suggestions:</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 21px;">A panel discussion would be nice.
