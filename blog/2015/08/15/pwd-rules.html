        <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This happens to me all the time: I have to create a password for a site that I dont use everyday, but its an important site, like a bank or insurance site. The site usually has some wierd set of rules that I obeyed when I created the account, but have forgotten now.<br /><br />So when I go in after a while and have to get in, I have some inkling of my password, but cannot get past the auth page because of some arcane rule that is not obvious to me then. Of course, I go through the reset password procedure and THEN they list out all the requirements for the new password.<br /><br />If I could see the rules one page ahead, though, I'd probably be able to remember my original one!<br /><br />So here's the idea: A website called PasswordRules that stores the password rules by site. You can query by site to get the rules for that site and use it to login. Simple!<br /><br />Better yet: Browser plugin that pops the rules up when you visit the site.<br />More: API for contributors and website owners to publish the rules programatically.<br /><br />Design:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Create a website that has:</li><ul><li>add new site and its rules</li><li>edit site rules</li><li>search for rules by site</li></ul><li>Create an API that allows:</li><ul><li>Search for rules by site</li><li>[optional] add/edit site rules </li></ul><li>Create a plugin for Firefox, Chrome, etc that:</li><ul><li>Uses the API to search for the current site and load up its rules in a popup</li></ul></ul></div>
